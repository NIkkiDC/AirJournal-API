## Reflections / Hurdles / Wins 
One thing I would do differently if I was given another project with a similar outcome is to really spend time learning, and familiarizing myself with the material I am not comfortable with FIRST. During the project there were a few concepts that were hazy to me, but I was able to search for different methods/ways to properly implement those things into my project successfully. I was learning as I went through with the project which was great, but I feel like that took up a lot of my time, and I wasn‚Äôt as confident.


I am most proud of the fact that I took this project as a learning experience. Anything I was not comfortable with I spent more time on. I asked more questions about it, and diligently completed research to successfully find the answer. I was more comfortable with the cucumber version of testing, so I went ahead and completed the testing utilizing the MVC. After completing so many test cases utilizing the MVC approach I grew more comfortable with the material.


One thing I would do next is implement a synopsis of each book.So if views are not familiar with the book titles the have more information to gauge their selection. I would also implement a small auto-biography of each author. Just some general facts of where they are from, when they began writing, and when was their first publish.


I learned a lot about how to properly utilize MVC. I know it‚Äôs something simple to most, but for me I had a tuff time properly obtaining, and inserting information in Postman. During this project I got the opportunity to successfully test all of my endpoints. {Before it was successful, I had a lot of hiccups} This is not tech related, but I learned a lot about 60% of these authors. I had never heard of some of these authors before, but I have read some of their books, I just never connected the author with the book. It was fun to actually learn some non-tech information doing this project as well.

Wanda Avery assisted me every step of the way with this project. She helped me understand connecting my api with the front end. Wanda is also a great cheerleader as well! She was very helpful when making sure I stayed on track.

Rachel Ehrlich assisted me with the beautiful icons I have. Rachel, and Wanda always make me realize that I do have an understanding of what I am doing, and do hold the answer in my head! I just need to be confident, and pratice more.

DeShe Woods helped me fix an error I was having with linking my API to my Angular application.

Dhrubo for making sure I was doing well with my time.
