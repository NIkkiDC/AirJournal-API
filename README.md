## Reflections / Hurdles / Wins 

Time management. Last project I spent my time wisely this time I allowed myself to get overwhelemed in the start of the project. I ended up spending 14-16 hour days on the last 3 days to make sure everything was working properly, and looked well enough to the standard that I hold for myself. I was able to complete everything, on time, to my liking, and I am proud of that. On Wednesday I spent a lot of time because I didn't want to stress myself out the night before it was due. I also wanted to make sure I was failing fast with the help of everyone during the day. Otherwise I would be SOL, If I had waited. I made sure to save simpler task for the last day. I spent the last day just touching up, and going over my speaking points.


I learned a lot about how to properly utilize MVC. I love using it because I feel I am getting better with it each time I use it

Wanda Avery assisted me every step of the way with this project. She helped me understand connecting my api with the front end. Wanda is also a great cheerleader as well! She was very helpful when making sure I stayed on track.

Rachel Ehrlich assisted me with the beautiful icons I have. Rachel, and Wanda always make me realize that I do have an understanding of what I am doing, and do hold the answer in my head! I just need to be confident, and pratice more.

DeShe Woods helped me fix an error I was having with linking my API to my Angular application.

Dhrubo, Leo, and Suresh for making sure I was doing well with my time.
